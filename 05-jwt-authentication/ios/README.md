# Realm JWT Sample 

1. Run cocoapods with `pod install --repo-update`
2. Open `RealmJWTSample.xcworkspace`
3. Run as SIMULATOR. The code is pointing to __localhost__
4. Make _both_ servers (auth-server.js and ros-server.js) in `../server` are running. You can just run both by `npm start` in that directory
